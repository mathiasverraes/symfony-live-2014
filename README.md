# Workshop: "Domain-Driven Design for Symfony Developers" at Symfony Live London 2014



Led by Mathias Verraes and Richard Miller

Domain-Driven Design helps us to tie our domain model to the business. Deep models have great value: they help us build systems that are more relevant. They communicate the meaning to the developers and the stakeholders. DDD can be quite opaque though. The patterns and practices often appear to be nothing but theory. In this session, Richard and Mathias will complement the theory with a practical approach. Youâ€™ll learn how to discover and evolve your domain model; how design patterns can help you translate it to code; and how you can glue it all together with a dash of Symfony.
